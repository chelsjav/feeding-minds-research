# Feeding Minds: How Lunch Status and Parental Education Affect Student Performance
Food For Thought Research Group: Chelsea Javier, Chelsea Jimenez, Nayeli De Anda

# üìÅ Description
This project investigates how lunch status such as free/reduced vs. standard correlates with student exam performance, exploring whether this relationship is influenced by parental education levels. By examining these socioeconomic factors, the study aims to examine potential disparities in academic outcomes and provide insights into how resources like school lunch programs may affect educational equity.

# üñáÔ∏è Research Question
How does lunch status (free/reduced vs. standard) correlate with student performance in exams, and does this relationship vary by parental education level?

### Null Hypothesis (H0)
There is no significant interaction between lunch status (free/reduced vs. standard) and parental education level on student exam performance. Any observed differences in exam scores among students with varying lunch statuses and parental education levels are due to random variation.

### Alternative Hypothesis (H1)
There is a significant interaction between lunch status and parental education level on student exam performance. Specifically, the effect of lunch status on exam scores varies depending on parental education level, with students from families with lower parental education levels and free/reduced lunch status performing differently than other groups.

# üî¨ Key Findings
- Students on standard lunch outperform students on free/reduced lunch across all subjects (math, reading, and writing).
- The impact of lunch status on test performance varies by parental education level.
- For students whose parents have lower education levels, the performance gap is more pronounced.
- For students whose parents have higher education levels, the gap narrows which suggest that higher parental education levels mitigates disadvantages associated with free/reduced lunch.
- Socioeconomic disparities remain a significant determinant of student performance, emphasizing the need for targeted support for free/reduced lunch students, particularly those with parents who have lower education levels.
- Therefore, we reject the Null Hypothesis.
